# Javascript Salary Calculator - Prime weekend challenge

Creating an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs.


## Description

This project was assigned as a weekend challenge to build a page that could take in employee data and display it in a table, including the ability to both add and remove employees.

The calculator required a form to collect an employee's first name, last name, ID, job title, and annual salary, submit that form and then append the submitted data in the DOM to an employee table below the form. The calculator also needed a way to remove each employee's entry from the table, as well as displaying the monthly salary and updating the monthly salary as employees were added or removed.

I created a separate .js file with an array of employees to pre-populate, primarily to make testing easier, but also for fun!

I also added a confirmation window pop-up whenever an employee is selected for deletion, which felt like a necessary part of the UX for any employee removal program.
